Carcass is a Javascript WebDAV client for web browsers.

The name of this software has been inspired by the [Cadaver](http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/) project.

The following libraries are required to Carcass:
* [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

Carcass relies on some Javascript ES5 features, which are not supported by old browsers.
You are therefore encouraged to load a polyfill (like [es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/)) to apply these features to your browser environment.
You should also load [Sarissa](http://www.dev.abiss.gr/sarissa/) to ensure that Ajax is correctly working on your browser.
